## Simples Marriage Proposal using Arduino

It uses ADAFruit PCD8544 display, a piezoeletric buzzer and an arduino. On the sample, I've created a mecanism that was responsible to bring up a engagement ring to her.
Simply using relays and a little engine that carries ring throught a rail and pops up.

Marriage didn't worked, but this one does!
I hope It help someone. =D
